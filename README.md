# Excercise on Linear Regression Analysis

# Objectives:
This project is a regression analysis of insurance data with objective to predict insurance costs based on various factors like age, gender, BMI, number of children
and smoking status. Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to understand the relationships between variables and make predictions. The main objective of 
this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict insurance costs for individuals. This will help insurance companies to better assess risk and 
set appropriate premiums. This can have significant implications for pricing, underwriting, and decision-making within the insurance industry.

# Approach
Following steps taken in the project:

    - Data Processing: Cleaning, handling missing data encoding categorial variables and normalizing the data as necessary.

    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to understand the relationship between variables, identify patterns and gian insights into the data.

    - Selecting relevant indipendent variables for regression model.

    - Run linear regression model.

    - Train the model using a portion of the dataset.

    - Evaluate the model's performance using below results
        - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
        - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
        - R-Squared

# Predictions

Using the trained model to to make predictions and report key insights.
